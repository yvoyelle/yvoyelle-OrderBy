/**
 * SQL sublanguage: DQL (Data Query Language)
 *
 * When we query a database for information, that information is not necessarily ordered. Physically,
 * that information is serialized in some order, but it is not necessarily the order you might expect, and the
 * order is subject to change. When querying for information we usually want to indicate the order for our results.
 * This is done with the ORDER BY clause.
 *
 * Example: SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 [, column2, column3, etc...] [ASC|DESC]
 *
 * When ordering by multiple columns, the priority is from left to right.
 *
 * We can order by columns in ascending or descending order. By default, ORDER BY is in ascending order. Ascending
 * order places lesser values before greater values. Descending order is the opposite, greatest values first.
 *
 * For example, one might add the ORDER BY clause after the WHERE clause of a query to order employees from highest to
 * lowest salary:
 *
 *      SELECT * FROM employee WHERE current = true ORDER BY salary DESC
